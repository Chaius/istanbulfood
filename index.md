## 11 Best things to do in Istanbul, Turkey

Perhaps one of the most beautiful ancient cities in Minor Asia, Istanbul is a modern Turkish crown jewelry city full of beautiful architecture and rich history dating all the way back to the 7th century before Christ when the Greek colonization its inhabitants and called it Byzantium.

Because its precise strategic location between the strong continents of Asia and Europe and the Bosphorus Strait divided it into two parts, the city has been subject to many conflicts for centuries.

The city has undergone many phases and iterations as it changes from one conqueror to another, changing its name from Byzantium to Constantinople under the Ottoman Emperor and finally Istanbul.

With a rich and vast history, of course, you'll find all sorts of beautiful past remnants of a wonderful church turning the Hague Sophia mosque into an ancient tank that lies beneath Istanbul and that's what we're going to help you find in the guidance of this journey.

Without further exaggeration, this is the 11 best things to do in Istanbul, Turkey. Let's start with a list of the best things to do all are on the map below:

### Stare At Hagia Sophia In Wonder
Hagia Sophia may be one of the most predictable places for me in Istanbul. I always wanted to see the part of that beautiful architecture was the Sophia Hague mosque with my own eyes and when I saw it, it wasn't disappointing.

Hagia Sophia is the crown jewel of the city. The first was built around 532-537 AD by the Byzantine Empire as the capital church before it was taken over by the Ottoman Empire and turned into a mosque in 1453. [istanbul en iyi restoranlar](https://www.yummyadvisor.com/tr-tr-Istanbul/)

After the Ottoman Emperor collapsed, the Turkish government decided to turn the mosque into a museum and start restoration work for most by 2020, where it eventually became a mosque again with many fans.

Back when it was a museum, you had to pay about 100 TRY to go in but now it's turned into a mosque for ordinary services, you're now free to go in as much as the heart is accepted despite all the burning discussions around the world about its conversion.

Once you're inside, you'll be surrounded by an incredibly large dome hallway all the yellow paintings and eight rounds of Arab calligraphy, a large round wood panel bearing the name of God, Mohammed, and his grandchildren; Hasan &amp;  Hussein, and four caliphs.

I've been to The Sofia a couple of times and every time I see the inside of it, my mind is always surprised by the fact that they are able to build such a large structure back before the industrial revolution. You can easily spend an hour here, just look around, explore all the little complicated murals and details you can find there.

Hagia Sofia is open from 9 a.m. to 6 a.m. every day in a week but because now this is an active mosque, this place is close for hours of prayer that you can keep track here for your visit. The good thing about Hagia Sophia being turned into a mosque is that you no longer have to pay for the entrance fee.

You can even visit The Hague of Sofia late at night and enjoy the quiet time between the amazing architecture of your own time as I do every night. One part of being a mosque is that you no longer have access to the balcony on the second floor and some pictures of Jesus are closed for religious purposes. Besides, The Hague Sofia is as beautiful as ever and now it's free, it's much more access than ever.

Today, the tanks are stored with a little water so that tourists can come down and explore the space freely. In the tank, you will find forests of more than 360 large marble columns supporting the city above some more famous than the other like a pillar with Medusa's head upside down basically and the other with Medusa's head on the side basically.

Dikatakan bahwa cistern dapat menyimpan lebih dari 80.000 meter kubik air yang cukup mengesankan mengingat itu dibangun di abad ke-6.  It really shows how advanced the Byzantine Empire is back on the Day of Resurrection.

It should take you about 30 minutes to get down, walk around the tank, and wake up again. Payment to enter the Basilica Cistern is 30 TRY per person and open from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day.

### Visit Grand Bazaar or The Spice Market

Grand Bazaar is a good place to walk and get a sense of what it feels like to be in the Middle East fragrance market. It's one of the biggest closed markets in the world covering 61 roads and having over 4,000 stores inside.

It's a network that spreads on streets full of people and stores selling all kinds of stuff like trinkets, jewelry, gifts, and souvenirs on both sides of the road.

Once you're inside, all your feelings will be involved from all directions with people's voices, smells, and visual colors of everyone and shop all the way.

This is something you have to experience when you travel to Turkey and there is no better place to do it than Grand Bazaar. Grand Bazaar is open from 10 a.m. to 6 a.m. every day and you're free to come in.

If you're looking for something closer to the Old Town, the Spice Market is also highly recommended. The Spice market and its surrounding area will provide the same experience as the Grand Bazaar but without you have to go far from the Old Town area.

### Check the view at the Suleymaniye Mosque

The Suleymaniye mosque is another impressive mosque that you should clearly visit when you are in Istanbul. In fact, I prefer this mosque to my own blue mosque. This one has a beautiful space, an amazing view, and an impressive interior design, what else can you ask in the mosque!

The Suleymaniye Mosque was built in the 16th century by the Ottoman Emperor on the third Hill giving him one of the best views in the Istanbul Galate area out there. The side of the mosque is a large cover over 59 meters long and 58 meters wide, forming a space full of amazing decorations and a wide area for you to enjoy.

There's also a big page right outside the mosque prayer room surrounded by a bow where you can go watch people. Right outside the gate, you'll also find an amazing point of view where you'll be able to see the Istanbul Galate area as a whole and also the New Istanbul in the background.

The journey to the Suleymaniye Mosque is a little long with many climbs but for the unsuitable and amazing interior, I assure you, you will find everything worthy. The mosque opened from 08:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., 1:00 a.m. to 2:30 a.m., and again from 3:30 a.m. to 4:45 a.m. with prayer rest among them. Tidak ada biaya masuk untuk masjid.

### Witness of local daily life on Galata Bridge

Since we've been exploring the old city for a while, it's time to cross the water and visit other parts of Istanbul, home to Galata Tower and Square Taxi but first, we have to cross the Galata bridge.

Galata Bridge is one of the best places to go watch people in Istanbul. This is a modern two-tier bridge connecting Karakoy district to Sultanahmet, the old city district.

On the top of the bridge, you'll find a lot of local people fishing off the bridge on the sidewalk. You can even friends some local people here and try your hand on fishing too.

If you want to spend time and relax in Bosphorus, you can also do it at the bottom of the bridge where you'll find a restaurant and coffee line with a pretty amazing view of Bosphorus strait.

Or you can do it free of charge at the Karakoy docks and enjoy an invincible view of the old town with pretzels in hand bought from street vendors nearby and good books elsewhere. I spent a lot of nights here watching the city end of the night.

### Raise Galactic Tower at sunset

One of the biggest sunsets in the city is at the top of the Galata Tower, the mid-century stone tower that dominated the city since the 14th century and offered an invincible panorama of the Istanbul peninsula.

The nine-story tower and you can see all the main tourist attractions like The Hague Sofia and the Blue Mosque from here. After inside, you can take one of the two lifts of operations to get to the top level where you'll find a restaurant and coffee if you have to rest, or you can just walk out to the balcony and blow up by the view of Istanbul city.

This city is beautiful when the sun sets and the blue clock is right when the city lights up and before the sky becomes completely dark. Depending on this season, you will have time for the sun to fall carefully and spend time to go row and through the crowd to get to the top.

The rate for the Galata Tower is 100 TRY per person. Menara terbuka dari 8:30 pagi sampai tengah malam di musim panas dan 10:00 sampai 8:00 pagi di musim dingin setiap hari seminggu.

### Visit Taxi Square

For the living part of Istanbul Taxi Square and the shopping path that leads there is one of the best places to walk and spend a day buying souvenirs or trying all kinds of street food.

The shopping lanes become really full at night and restaurants, cafes, and bars will be filled with people running for the day. This is a fun and living area that is contrary to what you've seen before in the old town area.

You can also take pictures or even get on the red tram icon the legacy of taxis connecting the Asian and European sides of the city from here. Tram operates between 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. every day and should be hard for you to track it after you're on the taxi mall.

### Eat your way Through the Asian side of Istanbul

Now that we spend more than a day exploring the European side, it will be a crime not to take the ferry across Bosphorus and explore what the Asian side of Istanbul has to offer.

To get from Europe to Asia Istanbul, you can take 3 TRY ferries from the Eminönü ferry terminal that will take you to the South Üsk ferry terminal on the Asian side of the city for 3 TRY and take about 15 minutes.

From there, you can walk along the coast south to the Maiden Tower (things to do on the list) and try all kinds of street food you find along the way. You'll be surprised how cheap food here is compared to the European side.

Thank my Turkish friend for taking me to try all the food on the road. These are some street food he suggested for all of you to try in Istanbul. I've been drowning just thinking about it:

Peynirli Gözleme: Turki flat-read dengan keju, bawang, dan selimut spinach.

Açma Ve Su Böreği: A sweet cake like baclava filled with beef cheese.

Midye Dolma: Museum smells rice.

Kokoreç: a sheep or goat's intestine wrapped around sweet bread. It may sound disgusting but it's really good and I highly recommend you try when you're here.

### Check out The Maiden's Tower

Finally, but not at least, when you walk south along the coast from the Üsk üdar ferry terminal, you'll see the Maiden Tower is an ancient lamp built on a small island on the Bosphorus track.

The light was built in the 18th century not long ago but it didn't stop the legend a about its location and its name to be developed among the local population.

A legend says that a lamp was built by a emperor who had a daughter who went to see an oracle and he begged that the daughter would be killed by a snake at the age of 18. To protect his daughter from this death, the Emperor built a tower in the middle of Bosphorus to keep her safe.

The emperor was the only one who could visit his daughter and on the 18th birthday, to celebrate their happiness in avoiding tragedy, his father brought him a fruit basket. After reaching the basket, the snake hid out of the basket, bit her daughter, and she died in her hand, until the name of the Maiden Tower.

Today, the light has been turned into a small museum and restaurant where you can take a local boat from the nearby beach and visit the Maiden Tower. The ship operates from 09:15 to 18:30 a day and operates every 15 minutes.
